# 100 Days of Python

Here's my homework for the Udemy-course [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)

My standard routine is/was to listen to the instructions, build my own code, thén listen to the explanation of the instructions, go back to my code to improve it (if needed), and thén listen to the solution and see if my solution had undiscovered issues. If I had another solution, but the outcome was still the same (or better :blush:), I left my solution untouched.
